            <h1 class="about">A little more about me</h1>
            <p class="p-about">Nobody told me that what I was doing all these years was a profession.

                Since I was little, I loved <b class="bold-about">talking to people</b> and asking a bunch of questions
                that they didn‚Äôt
                understand why I needed to know, but for me were <b class="bold-about">the key of everything.</b> It was
                my way to get to know
                them. Then, I discovered that the question was such as important as the answer. <b class="about-bold">I
                    learned to listen.</b> And
                with the pass of the years, <b class="bold-about">I fell in love with observing.</b> When I take the bus
                early in the morning and
                observe all those people faces, no one is pretending and I feel very lucky to be there.</p>

            <p class="p-about">Nobody told me that what I was doing (talking, asking questions, listening and observing)
                was a job and
                had a name.</p>

            <p class="p-about">And then, I found out. For me, the name was UX Researcher. And that with all that
                information I could
                create something for these people, something they would need and was such as useful as visually
                attractive, something called User Interface...</p>

            <p class="p-about">That moment was when I went crazy about the profession.</p>

            <p class="p-about"> I‚Äôm a UX and UI Designer.</p>
